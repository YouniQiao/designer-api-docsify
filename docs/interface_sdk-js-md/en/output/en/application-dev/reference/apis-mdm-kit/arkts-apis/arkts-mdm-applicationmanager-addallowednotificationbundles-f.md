```

Adds applications to the notification trustlist. After the notification trustlist is set, applications not in the trustlist cannot send notifications. > **NOTE** > > 1. If both the Kiosk mode and the notification trustlist policy are set, applications in the Kiosk mode and those > in the notification trustlist can send notifications. > 2. If the device notification capability has been disabled via > [setDisallowedPolicy]\_\_\_JSDOC\_LINK\_DESC\_USD\_0\_\_\_, calling this API to > set the notification trustlist will trigger error code 9200010. > 3. The notification trustlist does not apply to system services, which can always send notifications. System > applications are controlled by the notification trustlist. > 4. Cross-user settings are supported. The settings take effect immediately.
