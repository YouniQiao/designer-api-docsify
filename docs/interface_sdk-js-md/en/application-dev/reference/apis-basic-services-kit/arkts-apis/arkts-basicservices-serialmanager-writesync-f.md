# writeSync

## Modules to Import

```TypeScript
import { serialManager } from '@kit.BasicServicesKit';
```

## writeSync

```TypeScript
function writeSync(portId: number, buffer: Uint8Array, timeout?: number): number
```

Writes data to the serial port device synchronously. The length of data written each time cannot exceed 4 KB; otherwise, data loss may occur. You are advised to write long data in multiple packets.

**Since:** 19

**System capability:** SystemCapability.USB.USBManager.Serial

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| portId | number | Yes | Port number of the target device, which is obtained from the serial port parameter SerialPort returned by [getPortList](arkts-basicservices-serialmanager-getportlist-f.md). |
| buffer | Uint8Array | Yes | Destination buffer for writing data, with a maximum length of 4 KB. |
| timeout | number | No | Timeout interval.Unit: milliseconds. Whether the buffer of the target port is writable within the specified time. If yes, the API is processed properly; otherwise, a timeout message is returned after the specified time. The default value **0** indicates that the API returns the result immediately when the target port is not writable. |

**Return value:**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| number | Length of the data written. |
