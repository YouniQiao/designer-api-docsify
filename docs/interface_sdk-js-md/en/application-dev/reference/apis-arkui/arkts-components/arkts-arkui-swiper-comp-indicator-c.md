# Indicator

```TypeScript
declare class Indicator<T>
```

Sets the distance between the indicator and the **Swiper** component. Because the indicator has a default interaction area with a height of 32 vp, the displayed part cannot be completely stuck to the bottom. To achieve a completely bottom-aligned effect, use the [IndicatorComponent](arkts-arkui-indicatorcomponent-comp.md#indicatorcomponentinterface) component to adjust the position more flexibly.

**Since:** 10

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bottom | LengthMetrics &#124; [Length](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-length-t.md) | Yes | Sets the position of the bottom of the navigation dot relative to Swiper.<br>When top and bottom are not set, adaptive size layout is performed. Based on the size of the indicator itself and the size of Swiper, the indicator is placed at the bottom in the cross-axis direction, with the same effect as setting bottom to 0.<br>When set to 0: the layout is calculated based on position 0.<br>Priority: lower than the top attribute.<br>Value range: [0, Swiper height - navigation dot area height]. If the value exceeds this range, the nearest boundary value is used.<br>For the unit, see the description of the [Length](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-length-t.md) type. |
| ignoreSize | boolean | Yes | Sets whether to ignore the size of the navigation dot itself. The default value is **false**.<br>When set to **true**, the size of the navigation dot is ignored, so that the navigation dot can be placed closer to the bottom of Swiper. When set to **false**, the size of the navigation dot is not ignored, and the navigation dot is laid out at its default size. For usage, see [Example 9](../../../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-container-swiper.md#example-9-using-the-space-and-bottom-apis-on-the-navigation-indicator). <br> Note: When the navigation dot is of the [DigitIndicator](arkts-arkui-swiper-comp-digitindicator-c.md) type, the scenarios where it does not take effect are as follows:<br> • When [vertical](arkts-arkui-swiper-comp-attribute.md#vertical) is set to **false** and **bottom**   > 0.<br> • When [vertical](arkts-arkui-swiper-comp-attribute.md#vertical) is set to **true**:<br> 1. When **bottom**   > 0.<br> 2. When bottom is set to undefined. <br> 3. When **isSidebarMiddle** is set to **false**. |
