## cachedCount

```TypeScript
cachedCount(value: number)
```

Sets the number of child components to be preloaded. Based on the current page, the child components before and after the current displayed page are loaded. When an item before the current page is deleted, the items after it shift forward to fill the gap. For example, when **cachedCount** is set to **1**, the child components of the previous page and the next page adjacent to the current displayed page in index order are preloaded. If group-based page turning is set, that is, the **swipeByGroup** parameter of **displayCount** is set to true, preloading is performed in groups. For example, when **cachedCount** is set to **1** and **swipeByGroup** is set to **true**, the child components of the group before and the group after the current group are preloaded.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> - In continuous scrolling scenarios where one **Swiper** child component is displayed per screen, setting
> **cachedCount** to **1** or **2** is typically sufficient. For best practices, see
> [Optimizing Frame Loss During Swiper Component Loading – Caching Data Items](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/best-practices/bpta-swiper_high_performance_development_guide#section143504547145).

**System capability:** SystemCapability.ArkUI.ArkUI.Full

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value | Curve &#124; string &#124; ICurve | Yes | Animation curve. <br>The **string** type is deprecated since API version 9 (see [curves.init](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-curves-init-f.md), [curves.steps](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-curves-steps-f.md), [curves.cubicBezier](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-curves-cubicbezier-f.md), and [curves.spring](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-curves-spring-f.md)).

## customContentTransition

```TypeScript
customContentTransition(transition: SwiperContentAnimatedTransition)
```

Defines a custom page transition animation. During finger-following swipes and post-release transition animations, this triggers a frame-by-frame callback for all pages in the viewport, allowing you to customize animations by modifying properties like opacity, scale, and translation.

Instructions:

1) In a loop scenario, when the **prevMargin** and **nextMargin** attributes are set so that the front and rear areas of the **Swiper** viewport display the same page, this API does not take effect. 2) During finger-following swiping and the switch animation after the finger is released, the [SwiperContentTransitionProxy](arkts-arkui-swiper-comp-swipercontenttransitionproxy-i.md) callback is triggered frame by frame for all pages in the viewport. For example, when there are two pages with indexes **0** and **1** in the viewport, the callback is triggered twice per frame, with the index values **0** and **1** respectively. 3) When the **swipeByGroup** parameter of the **displayCount** attribute is set to **true**, if at least one page in the same group is in the viewport, the callback is triggered for all pages in the group; if no page in the group is in the viewport, all pages in the group are removed from the render tree together. 4) During finger-following swiping and the switch animation after the finger is released, the default animation (page sliding) still occurs. If you want the page not to slide, you can set a negative displacement (translate attribute) along the main axis to offset the page sliding. For example, when the **displayCount** attribute value is 2 and there are two pages with indexes 0 and 1 in the viewport, during horizontal page sliding, you can set the translate attribute of page 0 on the x-axis to -position * mainAxisLength frame by frame to offset the displacement of page 0, and set the **translate** attribute of page 1 on the x-axis to -(position - 1) * mainAxisLength to offset the displacement of page 1.

When the arrow is displayed, clicking the arrow turns pages. |

<a id="displaycount1"></a>

## displayCount

```TypeScript
displayCount(value: number | string | SwiperAutoFill, swipeByGroup?: boolean)
```

Sets the number of elements to display per page.

**number** type: Child elements' main-axis width adapts to the **Swiper** component's main-axis width. The child elements are stretched or shrunk to equally divide the **Swiper** component's width (minus **displayCount-1** times **itemSpace**). Values less than or equal to 0 are treated as the default value **1**.

**string** type: Only **'auto'** is supported. Child elements are laid out linearly based on their main-axis width without adapting to the **Swiper** component's width. [customContentTransition](#customcontenttransition) and [onContentDidScroll](#oncontentdidscroll) events are disabled.

**SwiperAutoFill** type: Child elements' main-axis width adapts to the **Swiper** component's main-axis width. The system automatically works out the number of elements per page based on the width and **minSize** settings of the **Swiper** component. If **minSize** is left empty or set to a value less than or equal to 0, the **Swiper** component displays one column.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> - When turning pages by group is used, the drag distance threshold for turning pages is half of the width of the
> **Swiper** component (50% of the child elements width if turning pages by child element is used). If the number
> of child elements in the last group is less than the value of **displayCount**, placeholders are used, but they
> show the **Swiper** background style directly and do not display any content.
> 
> - When **displayCount** is set to **'auto'** and **loop** is set to **false**, the position of the selected navigation indicator aligns with the first page in the viewport. If the first page is only partially displayed in the viewport after switching, the selected navigation indicator remains aligned with the page's position, between two unselected indicators. In this case, you are advised to hide the navigation indicators.
> 
> - If the navigation indicator is in dot style, the number of displayed navigation dots equals the number of child elements when the number of child elements displayed in the viewport is 1 (single-page scenario) or
> **displayCount** is set to **'auto'**.
> 
> - If **displayCount** is set to **'auto'** and **swipeByGroup** is set to **true**, each child element will be treated as a group for page switching, allowing only one page to be switched at a time. In this case, you are advised not to set **swipeByGroup** or set **swipeByGroup** to **false**.
> 
> - This API can be called within [attributeModifier](arkts-arkui-common-comp-commonmethod-c.md#attributemodifier) since API version 18.When the navigation indicator is set to dot style and the number of child elements displayed in the viewport is greater than 1 (multi-page scenario)<!--RP1--><!--RP1End-->, the number of displayed navigation dots follows the rules below.

```

Sets the number of elements to display per page.

**number** type: Child elements' main-axis width adapts to the **Swiper** component's main-axis width. The child elements are stretched or shrunk to equally divide the **Swiper** component's width (minus **displayCount-1** times **itemSpace**). Values less than or equal to 0 are treated as the default value **1**.

**string** type: Only **'auto'** is supported. Child elements are laid out linearly based on their main-axis width without adapting to the **Swiper** component's width. [customContentTransition](#customcontenttransition) and [onContentDidScroll](#oncontentdidscroll) events are disabled.

**SwiperAutoFill** type: Child elements' main-axis width adapts to the **Swiper** component's main-axis width. The system automatically works out the number of elements per page based on the width and **minSize** settings of the **Swiper** component. If **minSize** is left empty or set to a value less than or equal to 0, the **Swiper** component displays one column.

**ItemFillPolicy** type: Child elements' main-axis width adapts to the **Swiper** component's main-axis width. The number of displayed elements is determined based on the breakpoint type corresponding to the **Swiper** component's width. For example, if the breakpoint type is set to **ItemFillPolicy.BREAKPOINT_DEFAULT**, one column is displayed when the component width falls within the sm or smaller breakpoint range, two columns are displayed for the md breakpoint range, and three columns are displayed for the lg or a larger breakpoint range.

## duration

```TypeScript
duration(value: number)
```

Sets the duration of the animation for child component switching.

**duration** must be used in conjunction with [curve](#curve).

The default curve for the animation is [interpolatingSpring](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-curves-interpolatingspring-f.md). When this curve is applied, the duration of the animation is determined solely by the parameters of the curve itself and is no longer governed by the **duration** setting. For curves that are not governed by the **duration** setting, see [Interpolation Calculation](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-curves.md). Among others, [springMotion](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-curves-springmotion-f.md), [responsiveSpringMotion](../arkts-apis/arkts-arkui-curves-responsivespringmotion-f.md), and interpolatingSpring do not respect the **duration** setting. To have the animation duration managed by **duration**, you should select a different curve for the **curve** attribute.

## maintainVisibleContentPosition

```TypeScript
maintainVisibleContentPosition(enabled: boolean)
```

Sets whether to maintain the visible content position when data is inserted or deleted above or ahead of the viewport. This applies to **Swiper** components using a single [LazyForEach](../../../ui/rendering-control/arkts-rendering-control-lazyforeach.md) as the child node, where the data source is modified using **LazyForEach** API such as [onDataAdd](arkts-arkui-lazyforeach-comp-datachangelistener-i.md#ondataadd) or [onDataDelete](arkts-arkui-lazyforeach-comp-datachangelistener-i.md#ondatadelete). In other scenarios, the position of the visible content changes when data is inserted or deleted above or before the display area.

When **swipeByGroup** in [displayCount](#displaycount1) is set to **true**, the visible content position remains unchanged only if the amount of data inserted or deleted above or before the display area is a multiple of the group size. Otherwise, the visible content position may change during group recalculation.

**Since:** 20

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

**Atomic service API:** This API can be used in atomic services since API version 20.

Animations stop if the data source is modified during an animation due to target index changes. |

## nestedScroll

```TypeScript
nestedScroll(value: SwiperNestedScrollMode)
```

Sets the nested scroll mode between the **Swiper** component and its parent component. When the **Swiper** is nested in a scrollable container (such as **List** or **Scroll**), select an appropriate nested scroll mode based on business requirements. When [loop](#loop) is set to **true**, the **Swiper** component has no edge and does not trigger nested scrolling of the parent component.

> **NOTE:** 
> 
> The **Swiper** component's flick animation logic differs from other scrollable components, as **Swiper** can only
> slide one page at a time and performs a page-flip animation during a flick. When a **Swiper** component is nested
> with other scrollable components, it will not accept the scroll offset values transmitted by its child nodes
> after its page-turning animation has already started. At this point, the page-turning animation of the **Swiper**
> and the edge effect animation of the child node will be executed simultaneously.

## nextMargin

```TypeScript
nextMargin(value: Length, ignoreBlank?: boolean)
```

Sets the trailing margin to expose a small part of the next item. For the usage effect, see [Example 1](../../../reference/apis-arkui/arkui-ts/ts-container-swiper.md#example-1-setting-the-navigation-indicator-interaction-and-page-turning-effect). This attribute takes effect only when the layout mode of the Swiper child components is stretch, which mainly includes two scenarios: 1. The **displayMode** attribute is set to **SwiperDisplayMode.STRETCH**; 2. The **displayCount** attribute is set to the number type.

When the main axis runs horizontally and either **nextMargin** or **prevMargin** is greater than the measured width of the child component, both margins are hidden.

When the main axis runs vertically and either **nextMargin** or **prevMargin** is greater than the measured height of the child component, both margins are hidden.

When using the **nextMargin**\/**prevMargin** API, do not set the [constraintSize](arkts-arkui-common-comp-commonmethod-c.md#constraintsize) attribute for child components. Otherwise, the child node will not be stretched to the expected length along the main axis, and the margin will lose its effect.

## onContentDidScroll

```TypeScript
onContentDidScroll(handler: ContentDidScrollCallback)
```

Triggered when content in the **Swiper** component scrolls.

Instructions:

1) In a loop scenario, when the **prevMargin** and **nextMargin** attributes are set so that the front and rear areas of the Swiper viewport display the same page, this API does not take effect. 2) During page sliding, the [ContentDidScrollCallback](arkts-arkui-swiper-comp-contentdidscrollcallback-t.md) callback is triggered frame by frame for all pages in the viewport. For example, when there are two pages with indexes 0 and 1 in the viewport, the callback is triggered twice per frame, with the index values **0** and **1** respectively. 3) When the **swipeByGroup** parameter of the **displayCount** attribute is set to **true**, if at least one page in the same group is in the viewport, the callback is triggered for all pages in the group.

**Since:** 12

**Model restriction:** This API can be used only in the stage model.

## onContentWillScroll

```TypeScript
onContentWillScroll(handler: ContentWillScrollCallback)
```

Triggered when the **Swiper** component is about to scroll. This event allows you to intercept and control the scrolling behavior of the component. The component determines whether to allow the scroll action based on the return value. If **true** is returned, the scroll action is allowed, and the pages in the **Swiper** component will follow the scrolling. If **false** is returned, the scroll action is disallowed, and the pages will remain stationary.

1. This event is only triggered by gesture operations, including finger swipes,
scrolling the mouse wheel, and moving focus using keyboard arrow keys.

2. During finger swipes, the event is triggered for each frame.
The system uses the return value of the event to determine whether to respond to the swipe for each frame.

3. For scrolling the mouse wheel and moving focus using keyboard arrow keys,
the event is triggered once per page turning. The system uses the return value to decide whether to allow the page turning.
